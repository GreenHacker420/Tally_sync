## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FinSync360 team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **harsh@greenhacker.tech**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, here's what will happen:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability. This typically takes 1-7 days.

3. **Response**: We'll send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. This may include:
   - Request for additional information
   - Confirmation that the issue is valid
   - Notification that the issue is not valid

4. **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is accepted, we'll work on a fix and coordinate the release timeline with you.

5. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure of the vulnerability after a fix is available.

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to FinSync360, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries and ORM methods
- **XSS Prevention**: Escape output and use Content Security Policy
- **Authentication**: Implement proper JWT token handling
- **Authorization**: Verify user permissions for all operations
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets

#### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities

#### Environment Security
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use HTTPS in production
- Enable security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### For Deployments

#### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database connections encrypted
- [ ] API rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS/SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled
- [ ] Regular security updates applied

#### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backup and recovery testing
- Monitor for suspicious activities

#### API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use API versioning
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use CORS appropriately
- Monitor API usage
